This repository stores all my submitted answers for HWs.

Note that for each assignment, a maximum of 0.7 bonus point could be earn by submitting Scala point.

On the other hand for competition project, any RMSE score lower than 0.98 would get full 8 points. The top six students in the class would earn extra points on top of that.

1. Zeyang Gong (0.9721)

2. Jiemin Tang (0.9744)
